# This file contains common pin mappings for the BIGTREETECH SKR Pico V1.0
# To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the RP2040 with
# USB communication.

# The "make flash" command does not work on the SKR Pico V1.0. Instead,
# after running "make", copy the generated "out/klipper.uf2" file
# to the mass storage device in RP2040 boot mode
